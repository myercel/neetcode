Problem No. 133

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

Example 1:
    Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
    1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
    2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
    3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
    4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
